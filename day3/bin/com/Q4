Q4) Explain why the following block of code will give a compile time error?

public class Main {
public static void main(String[] args) {
float f=3.3;
System.out.println(f);
}
}

=>1> In this code programmer taking a float f = 3.3.
but compiler takes decimal value as double.

2>always double using storage greater than float that the reason of coming error. 

3>if you want converting value as float need to use of type_casting.

4>float f = 3.3f. that is correct way to type_casting only for float.


Correct code is: 

	public class Main {
		public static void main(String[] args) {
				float f=3.3f;
				System.out.println(f);
		}
	}
