Q1) Write the difference between JRE, JDK and JVM?
=> 1> JRE :- (Java Runtime Environment)
2> JDK :- (Java Development Kit)
3> JVM :- (Java Virtual Machine)
JDK is primarily used for code execution and has prime functionality of development. 
On other hand JRE is majorly responsible for creating environment for code execution. 
JVM on other hand specifies all the implementations and responsible to provide these implementations to JRE

Q2) Write the difference between JSE, JEE and JME?
=> 1> JSE :-(Java Standard Edition)
This is the core Java platform, it is a specification, which contains the core libraries to
develop standalone, networking, database, GUI, multithreaded types of applications.
In addition to the core API, the Java SE platform consists of the virtual machine,
development tools, deployment technologies and other class libraries and toolkit
commonly used in Java application
2> JEE :- (Java Enterprise Edition)
The Java EE platform provides an API and runtime environment for developing and
running large-scale, multi-tiered, scalable, reliable, and secure network applications.
3> JME :- (Java Micro Edition)
It is a subset of Java SE, designed used for microdevices and embedded development
like mobile phones, sensors, micro-controller, TV set-top boxes etc.

Q3) How does java achieve platform independency?
=> Java is platform-independent because it uses a virtual machine. 
The Java programming language and all APIs are compiled into bytecodes. 
Bytecodes are effectively platform-independent. 
The virtual machine takes care of the differences between the bytecodes for the different platforms.

Q4) What are features of Java and explain them?
=> Java is a dynamic language. It supports the dynamic loading of classes. 
It means classes are loaded on demand. It also supports functions from its native languages,
i.e., C and C++. Java supports dynamic compilation and automatic memory management (garbage collection);
