Q1) Explain Type casting and its types with examples?
=> Typecast is a way of changing an object from one data type to the next. 
It is used in computer programming to ensure a function handles the variables correctly. 
A typecast example is the transformation of an integer into a string.

Q3) Explain the difference between local and instance variables?
=>  A)Instance Variable:-
        1)They are defined in class but outside the body of methods.
        2)These variables are created when an object is instantiated and 
        are accessible to all constructors, methods, or blocks in class. 
        3)These variables are destroyed when the object is destroyed. 

    B)Local Variable:-
        1)They are defined as a type of variable declared within 
        programming blocks or subroutines. 
        2)These variables are created when a block, method or 
        constructor is started and the variable will be destroyed 
        once it exits the block, method, or constructor.
        3)These variables are destroyed when the constructor or method is exited.
