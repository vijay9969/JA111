	Q1) Differentiate between static and non-static variables?
	=>
	A:- Static. 
	1> A static variable acts as a global variable and is shared among all the objects of the class. 
	2> Static variables occupies less space and memory allocation happens once. 
	3> Static variables are shared among all instances of a class.  
	4> Static variable is like a global variable and is available to all methods. 
	
	B:- Non-Static.
	1> A non-static variables are specific to instance object in which they are created. 
	2> A non-static variable may occupy more space.
	3> Non static variables are specific to that instance of a class.
	4> Non static variable is like a local variable and they can be accessed through only instance of a class.
